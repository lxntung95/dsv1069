-- Compute the lifts in metrics and p-values for the binary metrics (30 day orders binary and 30 day views binary) 
-- using a 95% confidence interval.
-- 
-- Orders Binary Conclusion: There was a detriment of -1% in the orders between the control and treatment groups. But
-- with a p-value of 0.88, the results are not statistically significant. Therefore, we cannot reject the null
-- hypothesis and cannot conclude there is a statistically significant difference in item orders between the 2 groups.
-- 
-- Views Binary Conclusion: There was an improvement of +2.6% in the item views between the control and treatment
-- groups. However, with a p-value of 0.2, the results are not statistically significant. Therefore, we cannot reject
-- the null hypothesis and cannot conclude there is a statistically significant difference in item views between
-- the 2 groups.
